The final red black tree is very sensitive to the input order of nodes. After every insert, the fixup method loops 
depending on the layout to balance the tree. This includes rotations and recolors. So inserting in a different 
order causing the rotations and other parts to be in a different order. Overall there is probably hundreds of 
valid rb trees with the exact same nodes. So altering the insert order determines the final result, but it is still
always a valid rb tree.

The correct insertion sequence for the tree in the assignment is: [28, 21, 26, 14, 41, 47, 7, 23, 12, 30, 17, 38, 10, 19, 35, 16, 20, 15, 39, 3]
(This is the order I use in my program, but I thought I would just put it here too)
